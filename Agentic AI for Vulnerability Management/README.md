<h1 align="center"> # (POC) Agentic AI for Vulnerability Management</h1>

## Overview
This project explores a **proof-of-concept, agentic AI-driven vulnerability
management workflow** that goes beyond static CVSS scoring.

The system correlates **scan data, threat intelligence, exploitability signals,
MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and host context** to prioritize real-world risk and guide
remediation.

The goal is to demonstrate **end-to-end vulnerability management**, from detection
to governance, using an AI-assisted decision engine that can be extended into
production systems.

This project uses MITRE ATT&CK as a **shared language** between vulnerability
management, detection engineering, and threat hunting.

## Key Capabilities

⚡ **Risk-Based Prioritization**  
- Prioritizes vulnerabilities based on **active threat intelligence and exploitability**
- Uses CVSS as a *supporting* signal, not the primary driver

⚡ **Threat Intelligence Correlation**  
- Identifies vulnerabilities associated with:
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  - Known exploitation campaigns
  - High-impact infrastructure exposure

⚡ **MITRE ATT&CK Enrichment**  
- Adds attacker behavior context to vulnerability prioritization

⚡ **Host-Level Context**  
- Tracks vulnerable assets using:
  - Hostnames
  - Public / private IPs
  - Device-level details

⚡ **Actionable Executive Reporting**  
- Generates:
  - Executive summaries
  - Priority-based remediation timelines
  - Enrichment coverage metrics (CVSS, MITRE, host detail)

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Enrichment

To provide attacker-context-aware prioritization, this POC maps select vulnerabilities to relevant **MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques**.

This allows security teams to:
  - Understand how vulnerabilities may be abused in real attacks
  - Align remediation priorities with adversary behavior
  - Bridge vulnerability management with detection engineering and threat hunting

Coverage is behavior-driven and depends on available telemetry rather than static rule matching.

## End-to-End Vulnerability Management Workflow

This POC demonstrates the **full vulnerability lifecycle**:

### 1️⃣ Detection
- Ingests raw vulnerability scan results (e.g., Nessus)
- Deduplicates findings across hosts
- Normalizes severity and metadata

### 2️⃣ Prioritization
- AI-driven risk scoring based on:
    - Active exploitation intelligence
    - MITRE ATT&CK relevance
    - Infrastructure exposure
- Assigns clear remediation tiers:
    - Priority 1 (Immediate)
    - Priority 2 (Short-term)
    - Priority 3 (Ongoing)

### 3️⃣ Remediation Planning
- Produces:
    - Targeted patch guidance
    - Host-specific remediation context
    - Validation and follow-up recommendations

### 4️⃣ Communication & Governance
- Generates human-readable reports for:
    - Security leadership
    - IT operations
    - Detection & threat hunting teams
- Maintains historical scan summaries for trend tracking

## Example Outputs

  - 📊 Severity & priority breakdown
  - 🔥 Top 10 critical risks
  - 🧠 Executive summary with enrichment context
  - 🧾 Detailed vulnerability listings (CVSS, MITRE, hosts)
  - 📈 Long-term vulnerability posture tracking

## Why This Matters

Traditional vulnerability management:
  ❌ Treats all CVSS 9s equally  
  ❌ Lacks exploit context  
  ❌ Overwhelms remediation teams  

This agentic approach:
  ✅ Focuses effort where attackers are actually active  
  ✅ Bridges vulnerability management and threat hunting  
  ✅ Improves remediation speed and confidence

## 🗺️ Scope & Roadmap

This project demonstrates an **agentic, risk-based approach to vulnerability management**, focusing on:

  - Correlating scan results with threat intelligence and exploitability signals
  - Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on real-world attacker behavior
  - Enriching findings with MITRE ATT&CK context and host-level detail
  - Generating executive and technical reports to support remediation decisions

### Planned Enhancements
The following capabilities are intentionally out of scope for the current
implementation but represent logical next steps:

  - Automated ingestion of multiple scanner types and continuous scan feeds
  - Deeper exploit intelligence correlation (KEV, weaponization status)
  - Remediation workflow integration (ticketing, ownership, SLA tracking)
  - Validation and verification of remediation actions
  - Trend analysis and long-term risk posture visualization

### Non-Goals
  - Automated patch deployment
  - Replacement of vulnerability scanners
  - Full governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) platform functionality

This work is designed for **demonstration, education, and extension into production systems** while emphasizing explainability and human decision-making.
