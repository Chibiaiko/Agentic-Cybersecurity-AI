# What is a Cybersecurity Agentic AI ?

## Cybersecurity Agentic AI

**Cybersecurity Agentic AI** is a specialized class of Agentic AI focused on autonomously defending digital systems against cyber threats. It operates in adversarial environments, continuously detecting, analyzing, responding to, and mitigating security risks while adhering to strict compliance, safety, and trust constraints.

Cybersecurity Agentic AI systems:

  * Assume the presence of intelligent adversaries

  * Perform real-time threat detection and response

  * Execute controlled remediation actions

  * Integrate with security infrastructure (SIEM, SOAR, EDR, XDR)

  * Maintain auditability and human oversight for high-risk decisions

# What is Agentic AI?
    
  ## Agentic AI

**Agentic AI** refers to autonomous artificial intelligence systems capable of independently pursuing goals by observing their environment, reasoning over available information, planning multi-step actions, and executing those actions using integrated tools—while adapting behavior based on feedback.

Agentic AI systems are:
  
  * Goal-driven
  
  * Autonomous
  
  * Adaptive
  
  * Tool-enabled
  
  * Domain-agnostic

These systems move beyond reactive responses and operate as proactive agents capable of initiating actions without continuous human instruction.
