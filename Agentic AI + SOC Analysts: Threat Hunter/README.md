<h1 align="center">Agentic AI + SOC Analysts: Threat Hunter</h1>

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **prototype, AI-augmented threat hunting workflow**
where an agentic AI collaborates with SOC analysts to:

    - 🔍 Hunt threats in security telemetry
    - ⚡ Intelligently prioritize suspicious activity
    - 📝 Investigate and document findings
    - 🛡️ Align investigations with MITRE ATT&CK

The system dynamically translates analyst intent into **log queries**, analyzes
results using an LLM, and returns structured threat findings for human review.

This work is designed for demonstration and iterative expansion toward a
fully ATT&CK-driven threat hunting platform, with humans kept firmly in the loop.

This project uses MITRE ATT&CK as a **shared language** between vulnerability
management, detection engineering, and threat hunting.

## Key Capabilities

🔍 **Threat Hunting**
        - Converts analyst questions into log analytics queries
        - Searches identity, authentication, and endpoint telemetry
        - Focuses on high-signal behaviors, not alerts alone
        
⚡ **Intelligent Prioritization**
        - Filters noisy log data before LLM analysis
        - Highlights suspicious patterns worthy of analyst attention
        - Reduces time-to-insight during hunts
        
📝 **Investigation & Documentation**
        - Produces narrative explanations of suspicious behavior
        - Structures findings for analyst review
        - Supports repeatable, explainable threat hunts
        
🛡️ **MITRE ATT&CK Alignment**
        - Designed to support ATT&CK-driven hunting
        - Enables mapping of observed behaviors to tactics & techniques
        - Helps SOC teams hunt by adversary behavior, not tool signatures

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework

This project is designed around the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** for adversary behavior–driven threat hunting.

SOC analysts can use the official ATT&CK matrix to:
- Plan hypothesis-driven hunts by tactic and technique
- Identify telemetry gaps
- Validate coverage across the kill chain
- Align investigations with industry-standard adversary models

Coverage is behavior-driven and depends on available telemetry rather than static rule matching.

## MITRE ATT&CK Coverage 

The framework is capable of supporting **multiple ATT&CK tactics**, depending on:
- Log sources queried
- KQL queries used
- Prompt design

| MITRE Tactic | Supported | How |
|-------------|----------|-----|
| Initial Access | ⚠️ Partial | Suspicious logon patterns |
| Credential Access | ✅ Yes | Logon events, callers, identities |
| Discovery | ⚠️ Partial | Identity & device exploration |
| Lateral Movement | ⚠️ Partial | Caller/device relationships |
| Command & Control | ⚠️ Partial | Depends on log source |
| Defense Evasion | ⚠️ Partial | Requires expanded telemetry |
---

## What This POC Does Well

✅ Demonstrates **agentic decision-making**  
- AI chooses *what* to query, not just *how to analyze*

✅ Reduces analyst cognitive load  
- Pre-filters massive logs  
- Summarizes suspicious activity  

✅ Enables hypothesis-driven threat hunting  
- Analyst → AI → Logs → AI → Analyst loop  
---

## Current Gaps (Honest Assessment)

🎯 The following MITRE stages are **not yet fully implemented** but are architecturally supported:

- Resource Development
- Execution
- Persistence
- Collection
- Exfiltration
- Impact

These require:
- Additional log tables
- Expanded KQL queries
- Explicit MITRE tagging in prompts or output schemas
---

## Why This Matters

Traditional SOC workflows:
  ❌ Alert-driven  
  ❌ Reactive  
  ❌ High analyst burnout  

This agentic approach:
  ✅ Supports proactive threat hunting  
  ✅ Keeps humans in the loop  
  ✅ Makes investigations faster, clearer, and repeatable

🗺️## Scope & Roadmap

This project demonstrates the **core architecture and agentic workflow**
for ATT&CK-driven threat hunting, including:

- Agent-led selection of log sources, fields, and time ranges
- LLM-assisted behavioral analysis of security telemetry
- Human-in-the-loop review and investigation of hunt results

### Planned Enhancements
The following capabilities are intentionally out of scope for the current
implementation but represent clear next steps:

- Explicit MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique tagging in hunt outputs
- Expanded telemetry coverage (process, persistence, network, execution)
- ATT&CK-aligned hunt playbooks per tactic
- Analyst confidence scoring and triage prioritization
- Structured outputs suitable for case management or ticketing systems

### Non-Goals
- Fully automated response or remediation
- Production-scale performance tuning
- Replacement of SOC analyst decision-making
